# GitPitch UML Diagrams

GitPitch UML diagram support is powered by <a target="_blank" href="http://plantuml.com">PlantUML</a>. PlantUML is a wonderful library that let's you create UML Diagrams from simple text-based descriptions. From these simple text-based descriptions, GitPitch generates and renders pixel-perfect UML diagrams as SVG images on your slides.
 
See the [GitPitch Docs](https://gitpitch.com/docs/rich-media-features/uml-diagrams) for further details.

View the `raw` **PITCHME.md** markdown and accompanying **assets/css/PITCHME.css** to see how each slide in the presentation has been implemented.
