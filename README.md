# A Modular Markdown Demo

Demonstrates the use of the modular markdown where the content of the main `PITCHME.md` is provided by a series of other markdown files that are included using special GitPitch `include` syntax.

View the `raw` **PITCHME.md** markdown to see how each slide in the presentation has been implemented.
