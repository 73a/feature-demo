### The Process of UX Design

#### CMPT 363

<br>

“Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is
nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing
more to take away.”

<br>

@ul[shrink-items](false)
- Software development as pure production
- Knowing all required information upfront
- Time estimates are extremely hard to make
- Open entire project must be completed to fully test
- Long feedback and development cycles

### Agile Manifesto
<br>

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

### Lean Development
##### Based on the Toyota Way*

@ul[long-items](false)
- A mindset, or **way of thinking**, commitment to achieve a totally waste-free opera8on that’s focused on your customer’s success
- It is achieved by **simplifying and continuously** improving all processes and relationships in an environment of trust, respect and full employee involvement
- It is about people, simplicity, flow, visibility, partnerships and true value as **perceived by the customer**

### With Lean each Design (Decision) is Viewed as a Hypothesis
<br>
A hypothesis can be defined as an educated guess that then can be tested to be shown correct

### What is the difference between a user goal and a task?

---

### User Goal vs. Task

#### Goals
<br>

- Things users want or need to achieve
- Tend to remain constant over time
- System independent
- Reaching a goal changes the state of the world

---

### User Goal vs. Task

#### Tasks
<br>

@ul[shrink-items](false)
- Must be performed to reach goals
- Tend to change over time, often due to technology
- System dependent
- May require problem solving
@ulend

---

### Questions to Help Discover User Goals and Tasks
<br>

@ul[shrink-items](false)
- Why would they use the system (goals)?
- What do they need to do to reach their goals (tasks)?
- What are common problems encountered?
- When would they use the system?
- Where would they be using the system?
@ulend

---?color=#2d6e92

### Activity: User Goals vs. Tasks

<br>
#### THINK-PAIR-SHARE

Examples of student goals and tasks for using the GoSFU course registration system?

---

### Example Task Analysis Tools
<br>

- Task inventory (incl. frequency & importance)
- Task frequency & importance matrix
- Task sequences
- Flowcharts

---

#### Task Importance & Frequency Matrix
<br>

| Task List | User Group #1 | User Group #2 | User Group #3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Task #1 | High/Frequent | High/Infrequent | Low/Infrequent |
| Task #2 |  Never | Low/Infrequent | High/Frequent |
| Task #3 | Low/Infrequent | Never | High/Infrequent |
| Task #4 | Low/Infrequent | Low/Infrequent | Low/Infrequent |

---

### @size[0.9em](Organizing an Interface by Tasks)
<br>

@ul[shrink-items](false)
- Important & frequent - higher visibility, fewer taps
- Important & infrequent - higher visibility, more taps
- Unimportant & frequent - lower visibility, fewer taps
- Unimportant & infrequent - lower visibility, more taps

### @color[black](Strategize & Prioritize)

---?image=assets/img/ux-toolkit-8.png&size=contain&color=white

---

### Strategize & Prioritize
<br>

- Content strategy
- Journey maps
- Kano model
- Problem statement
- Product design principles
- Product Reac9on Cards
- Usability/UX goals
- Valuing UX

---

### Usability Goals - How it Works
<br>

- Learnability (first-time users)
    + The product should be easy to learn
- Efficiency (experienced users)
    + The product should be efficient to use
- Memorability (casual users)
    + The product should be easy to remember
- Error-resistance (all users)

---

### Defining Usability Goals
<br>

- Common factors for consideration are
    - Frequency of use
    - Importance of task or need
    - Task structure (e.g. complexity, reptition)
    - Motivation/Attitude
- Assign a priority to each goal (e.g. 1-3)
    - @size[0.8em](Could be specifically measured, but overall usability assessment e.g. SUS is usually sufficient)

### UX Goals - How it Feels
<br>

@ul[many-items](false)
- [Product Reaction Cards by Microsoft (2002)](http://www.microsoft.com/usability/UEPostings/ProductReactionCards.doc)
- 118 words (60% positive, 40% negative)
- Sample words
- Appealing
- Complex
- Familiar
- Hard to use
- Organized
- Relevant
- Too technical
- Valuable
@ulend

### Defining UX Goals with Product Reaction Cards
<br>

@ul[shrink-items](false)

- Heuristic review
- Usability testing (informal and formal)

---

### Measuring Usability Goals

- Learnability (first-1me users)
    - Can a new user complete a task?
- Efficiency (experienced users)
    - How fast can a user complete a task?
- Memorability (casual users)
    - How easy can a repeat user recall how to complete a task?
- Error-resistance (all users)
    - How often does the software cause users to make an error?

---

### Measuring UX Goals with Product Reaction Cards
<br>

- Measuring
    - Reduce attributes to ≈ 60 to 80
    - Ask participants to select most relevant 10
    - Visualize the results (e.g. word cloud)

---?image=assets/img/wordcloud.jpg&size=auto 70%

### @size[0.95em](Activity: Product Reaction Cards)
<br>
